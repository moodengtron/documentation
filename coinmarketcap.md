# Please follow up your initial application with a public verification post. 
In order for us to display your contract address and explorer data, please make a public post using one of the accounts (e.g. social media) associated with the URLs found on the project's official website. In the post, mention the (i) ticket number that you received from your CMC application and (ii) CMC Dexscan URL (if available, e.g. https://tinyurl.com/28r22789). Provide the URL to the public post so that the CMC team can verify the information. This would give the team a greater degree of assurance in ascertaining the legitimacy of the request. This would prevent scammers from planting fake contract addresses. In addition, feel free to provide telegram @username of someone who can vouch for the legitimacy of this application.
